Investment Guru Website

Proposed Level of Achievement: Gemini

Target Audience: Novice/experienced investors and people looking to learn investing

Motivation:  We realize that in 2020, there has been a rise in enthusiasm for people looking to learn about trading and investing.  This is evinced from the recent popularity of trading courses online.  We hope that there can be a more free and open community to help one another to learn about investment and trading. In Particular, there are many university students who are looking to be financially independent and reap passive income through such means. Additionally,   the website can also tap on the experience of knowledgeable members of the community to teach and educate beginner investors on advanced trading knowledge.

Aim: To educate people about investing and encourage experienced investors to share trade ideas

Scope of project: 

The website will allow for users to register accounts and create their own profile.  Under their profile, they will be able to post educational information and teach other people how to invest.  They can create posts and links to investment related trading information in order to share their knowledge.  The posts can be of any topic (e.g. finance, fundamental analysis, DD, technical analysis etc) and can be tagged.  There will be a search engine functionality to make their content accessible to those who are searching for it.

Because people can upvote or follow certain users, these users will rise in popularity and be more acknowledged.  This is in contrast to the slew of information online which might be false or inaccurate, so this attracts potential investors to rely on our website instead of just googling online.  There will also be a forum for people to ask questions and discuss.

Functionalities:

1) Search engine to search for information.

-Users will be able to search for content using keywords and obtain the information that they seek

2) Forum for InvestmentGuru community to exchange idea and information

-Enable beginner investors to learn more from experienced individuals, and experienced individuals to share their knowledge

-Exchange information and opinions about investment/trading strategies.

3) Allows users to create accounts, create posts, and share with others.

-From these accounts, users will be able to post in the forum

-Users can customize their own profile details

4) Users can subscribe to an email newsletter. 

-Receive an email notification whenever there is a new article uploaded/post in the forum
