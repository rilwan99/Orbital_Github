          technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of
          computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are
          generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them
          theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

          More than 10,000 different cryptocurrencies are traded publicly,
          according to CoinMarketCap.com, a market research website. And
          cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate, raising money through
          initial coin offerings, or ICOs. The total value of all
          cryptocurrencies on May 27, 2021, was more than $1.7 trillion — down
          from April high of $2.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

          Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer
          funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted
          third party like a bank or credit card company. These transfers are
          instead secured by the use of public keys and private keys and
          different forms of incentive systems, like{" "}

          However, the semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions
          makes them well-suited for a host of illegal activities, such as money
          laundering and tax evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often
          highly value their anonymity, citing benefits of privacy like
          protection for whistleblowers or activists living under repressive
          governments. Some cryptocurrencies are more private than others as
          well.
