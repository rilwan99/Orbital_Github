          A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the
          ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of

        <p className="body-text">
          Corporations issue (sell) stock to raise funds to operate their
          businesses. The holder of stock (a shareholder) has now bought a piece
          of the corporation and, depending on the type of shares held, may have
          a claim to a part of its assets and earnings. In other words, a
          shareholder is now an owner of the issuing company. Ownership is
          determined by the number of shares a person owns relative to the
          number of{" "}

          For example, if a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and
          one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have claim to
          10% of the company's assets and earnings.

          Stock exchanges are secondary markets, where existing owners of shares
          can transact with potential buyers. It is important to understand that
          the corporations listed on stock markets do not buy and sell their own
          shares on a regular basis (companies may engage in stock{" "}

          or issue new shares, but these are not day-to-day operations and often
          occur outside of the framework of an exchange). So when you buy a
          share of stock on the stock market, you are not buying it from the
          company, you are buying it from some other existing shareholder.
          Likewise, when you sell your shares, you do not sell them back to the
          company—rather you sell them to some other investor.

        <p className="body-text">

          generate investment returns that are superior to those from every
          other asset class. Stock returns arise from{" "}

            dividends

          . A capital gain occurs when you sell a stock at a higher price than
          the price at which you purchased it. A dividend is the share of profit
          that a company distributes to its shareholders. Dividends are an
          important component of stock returns—since 1956, dividends have
          contributed nearly one-third of total equity return, while capital
          gains have contributed two-thirds.

          stage is one of the more tantalizing prospects of stock investing, in
          reality, such home runs are few and far between. Investors who want to
          swing for the fences with the stocks in their portfolios should have a
          higher tolerance for risk; such investors will be keen to generate
          most of their returns from capital gains rather than dividends. On the
          other hand, investors who are conservative and need the income from
          their portfolios may opt for stocks that have a long history of paying
          substantial dividends.
